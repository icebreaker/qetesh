Qetesh
======
Qetesh is a Hieroglyphic Editor.

![](https://raw.github.com/icebreaker/qetesh/master/images/qetesh.png)

You should consider it *alpha quality*; take everything with a grain of salt and
pepper for that matter.

> No Hieroglyphs were harmed during the making of Qetesh.

Qetesh doesn't use a database and stores everything on the client side using 
local storage.

Play with [Qetesh](http://szabster.net/qetesh).
